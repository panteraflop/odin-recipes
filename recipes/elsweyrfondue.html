    <h1>Elsweyr Fondue</h1>

        <img src="images/elsweyrfondue.jpg" alt="Elsweyr Fondue">

        <p>Elsweyr Fondue is a delicious and hearty dish popular in Skyrim.
            Nothing quite beats gathering with friends and family around the
            fondue pot, sharing the simple joy of warm cheese and fresh bread
            Elsweyr fondue is unique in that it utilises three ingredients: ale, 
            moon, sugar, and an Eidar cheese wheel. As such, the cheesy flavour 
            is made more complex with the use of blue Eidar cheese, as well as 
            the warm bitterness of ale and a hint of sweetness from the moon sugar.
