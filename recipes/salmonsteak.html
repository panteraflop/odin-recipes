    <h1>Salmon Steak</h1>

        <img src="images/salmonsteak.jpg" alt="Salmon Steak">

        <p>Salmon are abundunt in the cold clear rivers of Skyrim and naturally make 
            for a delicious meal in many different forms. Today, I will be sharing a 
            recipe for salmon steak, which is simple to make and is filling and 
            delicious! The key to a good salmon steak is to ensure that it is cooked
            on high heat so that it is crisp and seared on the outside while remaining 
            juicy inside. Serve alongside any vegetable dish of choice for a wholesome
            meal, such as a fresh salad, mashed potatoes, or Elsweyr Fondue!
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>You will need:</li>
            <li>2 thick salmon fillets, deboned and with skin on</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp teriyaki sauce</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Fresh dill stalks</li>
            <li>3 tbsp sour cream</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>At least 3 hours prior to cooking, start to marinade your salmon</li>
            <li>Roll salmon lightly in sea salt</li>
            <li>In a bowl, add the olive oil, pepper, teriyaki sauce, garlic, and a pinch of dill, and mix well</li>
            <li>Use your hands to rub this mixture into the salmon, making sure both the skin and meat are evenly seasoned</li>
            <li>Cover with cling wrap and refrigerate</li>
        </ol>

        <p>When the salmon has absorbed the marinade, heat a pan to the maximum
            heat and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Cook salmon skin side down 
            until skin is crispy, then turn over and cook for an additional 5-7 
            minutes.
        </p>

        <p>To serve, mix plucked dill leaves with sour cream and place a dollop
            on the side of your dish. Enjoy!</p>
